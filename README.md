Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

Customer segmentation is a key strategy in business and marketing, where customers are divided into different groups based on their characteristics, behaviors, or purchasing patterns. Machine learning techniques, especially clustering algorithms like K-Means, are widely used for this purpose. K-Means clustering helps businesses identify distinct customer groups, allowing for targeted marketing strategies, personalized recommendations, and improved customer satisfaction.

The Main Objective of this project is to segment customers into different clusters based on relevant features such as spending behavior, purchasing history, or demographics. This helps businesses better understand their customer base and make data-driven decisions.
